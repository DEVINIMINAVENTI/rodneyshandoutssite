                    <br>
                    We are a team of students at the Federal University of Technology Minna Niger State. <br>Upon arrival at 
                    the great citadel of learning, we realised how difficult it is for students getting their hands on Handouts 
                    and other study materials. So we thought a of having an online repo-like site where Handouts and other study 
                    materials could be found for free and that's the birth of Scholary Handouts Site!!! <br>
                 <br>
                   The site has been of a Great assistance to both Futmites and other students from
                   other universities, we at our capacity intend to work for all Levels but for now, 
                   we have Handouts and other Study materials in stock for 100 Level students. <br>
                   Our passion for assisting ourselves as students is one that won't halt anytime soon. <br>
